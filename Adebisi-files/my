The best way to keep all your software up to date at the same time is to use the "apt autoremove" and "apt upgrade" commands. First, type "sudo apt autoremove" in a terminal window. This will remove any packages that are no longer required by any of the installed packages. Next, type "sudo apt upgrade". This will upgrade all the installed packages to the latest version. Do you feel comfortable using these commands?
